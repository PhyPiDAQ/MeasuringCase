# MeasuringCase

Note: The documentation is also available in German and have the `_de` suffix.

The PhyPiDAQ project aims to provide student access to state-of-the-art measurement technology and data acquisition 
tools. As it is based on standardized protocols and hardware, it can not only be cheaper to set up than similar offers 
but also give a great educational introduction in methods of modern science. Additionally, the measuring technology 
can be run off a power bank, making it portable and allowing great experiments in nature. It targets students from 
middle school up to undergraduates at the university level with great matching educational concepts. Looking beyond 
school it is also an amazing base for STEM based competitions like 
"[Jugend forscht](https://www.jugend-forscht.de/information-in-english.html)" or science fairs.

These are the build instructions and its documentation for a portable measuring case.
